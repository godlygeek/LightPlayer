# LightPlayer
This project provides an Arduino sketch for driving a 200 pixel LED matrix.  Frames are read from an SD card and transmitted to the lights, at a max of 20 frames per second.  Video selection and playback and color settings are achieved using a serial protocol via [LightControlBridge](https://github.com/godlygeek/LightControlBridge).
